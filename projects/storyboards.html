      <h2>PROJECT 5: STORYBOARDS</h2>
      <img src="../images/storyboards.gif" alt="storyboards">
      <p class="left">I am currently considering the concept of an app/webite that allows people to simulate the experience of music through senses other than sound. These simulations would ultimately be experienced by people who suffer from some form of hearing impairment.
        The app would wirelessly connect to a patch that is worn by the hearing-impaired user and relays the simulations that are provided by other users via the app/website. After creating storyboard sketches and using them as an aid to explain this concept to some of my peers, I received affirmations that the idea of bridging the gap between those who can and cannot hear would definitely be worth pursuing. Despite being a bit scatter-brained and messy, these storyboards were extremely helpful in conveying what I am interested in doing.</p>
