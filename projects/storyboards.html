      <h2>PROJECT 5: STORYBOARDS</h2>
      <img src="../images/storyboards.gif" alt="storyboards">
      <p>My storyboards are based on the concept of an app/webite that allows people to simulate the experience of music through senses other than sound. These simulations would ultimately be experienced by people who suffer from some form of hearing impairment.
        The app would wirelessly connect to a patch that is worn by the hearing-impaired user and relays the simulations that are provided by other users.</p>
