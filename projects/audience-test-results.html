            <h2>AUDIENCE TEST RESULTS</h2>
            <p class="left">The audience test period was an extremely helpful and insightful experience. Although the version of our project that we shared with our test users was in a rough state, both seemed to enjoy the concept and where it was going and only suggested minor changes.</p>
            <p class="left">This experience reinforced the importance of allowing people to review your work before finalizing it. Without feedback from other people, especially target audience members, one risks missing out on ideas that could potentially elevate their resulting product.</p>
