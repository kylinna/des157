            <h2>AUDIENCE TEST RESULTS</h2>
            <p class="left">The audience test period was an extremely helpful and insightful experience. Although the version of our project that we shared with our test users was in a relatively unfinished state, both test users seemed to enjoy the concept and where it was heading and only suggested minor changes. For example, one audience member, who has a background in sound design, suggested alternative ways we could simulate audio beyond solely relying on amplitude. He shared information about the role that frequencies play in the way that people perceive music. This was useful because my partner and I have been trying to figure out other ways we could visually communicate sound. The other test user made the suggestion of having the song play through the duration of the questionnaire, as we previously had it set up to only play a sample in the beginning. This user explained that doing this would lend well to the add-on process that we have going and give other users a better glimpse of what their resulting experience would be.</p>
            <p class="left">Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of allowing people to review my work before finalizing it. There are so many different perspectives out there, and because one generally designs for more than one person, it is crucial to consider as many perspectives as possible. Without feedback from other people, especially target audience members, one risks missing out on ideas that could potentially elevate their resulting product.</p>
