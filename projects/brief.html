            <h2>PROJECT 7: PROJECT BRIEF</h2>
            <h3>Topic Summary</h3>
            <p class="left brief-spread">My project’s topic revolves around deepening peoples’ overall connection to music and expanding its sensory realm in order to make it more accessible for everyone. With this in mind, I plan to design a website and mobile application that allows people to create their own haptic-visual simulations of their favorite songs by progressing through a series of guided phases. Users would have the ability to share their completed simulations on the app/website, as well as view other users’ interpretations. In addition to the app/website, a wireless patch would be available to connect to the app, and ultimately, relay those simulations to the wearer.</p>


            <h3>Target Audience Description</h3>
            <p class="left">Because there will essentially be two parts (app/website and wireless patch) to my project, my product will be designed with two audiences in mind. My primary audience is people who suffer from deafness or some other form of hearing impairment and are interested in deepening their connection to music or are simply seeking a way to passively engage one of their senses while doing an activity (i.e. running, studying, cooking, shopping).</p>

            <p class="left brief-spread">My secondary audience ranges from preteens to young adults, particularly between the ages of 11 and 26. I feel that people within this age group would be most interested in contributing to the community, especially those with a creative background or an interest in music.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p class="left brief-spread">My ultimate goals for this project are to facilitate an alternative music experience for people who suffer from hearing impairment and to use music as a basis for connection between those who can and cannot hear. If successful, I will have also offered a new way for people to not only enhance their creativity and storytelling skills, as well as inspired analytical thinking about music and how it personally impacts people.</p>

            <h3>Visual Strategies</h3>
            <p class="left brief-spread">Although the wireless patch is primarily intended for deaf users and the online community is primarily intended for users that can hear, these groups and their roles in the project are not set in stone. Each aspect of my project will be designed in a way that would be just as practical for users if the roles were switched. That being said, I’d like the design of the mobile and browser interface to first and foremost be as simple and straightforward as possible. I’d also like to convey a playful, inviting, and therapeutic mood. To achieve this, I will rely heavily on color, simple iconography, and geometric sans-serif typefaces. I will pay special attention to the subtle details that occur as one navigates the app and website in order to channel my desired mood and provide an engaging user experience. The wireless patch would be extremely simple and easy to use as well, with a multi-use button and colored lights to signify its current state.</p>
