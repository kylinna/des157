      <h2>PAPER PROTOTYPES</h2>

      <p class="left">By the time ten minutes had passed, I was fully aware that I was missing important information, but it was interesting to discover what information other people considered most important as they navigated through my website. I even received feedback
        on things that I hadn't even considered before, such as some issues with consistency. For example, I began my initial phase with "Step 1: ..." but I didn't continue titling the latter phases in that manner. It's funny how something as slight as
        the way you title each of your pages can make an immense difference in the way one perceives your website and their overall user experience. Another thing I overlooked is a link to an explore page or dashboard. After users are done completing
        a simulation, they are able to view other peoples' constributions, but there is no way to access that from the landing page. However, the most crucial thing that I forgot to incorporate is an area to connect pair the wireless device that I'm hoping
        to incorporate into my project. Overall, the main thing I gained from this exercise is a more broadened and realistic outlook on how many elements are needed to create an easy-to-navigate website, as well as the importance of user-testing.</p>
